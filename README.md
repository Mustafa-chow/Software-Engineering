# CHANGE REQUEST
(1) Change Request: “Add  a  slider  bar  to  the  bottom  of  the  application  for  controlling  zoom in/out.”

(2) : “Add a new tool to draw regular or irregular Pentagons. After writing the 
pentagon,  it  should  automatically  stamp  user  specified  name  in  the middle  of  that pentagon with a  font size  appropriate to the  size  of  the pentagon drawn. The user should be able to choose regular or irregular pentagon. This new tool should work exactly like any other tools in the easyPaint  application.  You  must  use  proper  icons  and  shortcut  for  this 
selection instrument.”

(3) “Add a new convex pentagon selection instrument feature for selecting images. This new instrument shall meet all the features of the original selection instrument. You must use proper icons and shortcut for this selection instrument.”

I implemented those chare request for my software engineering class.
