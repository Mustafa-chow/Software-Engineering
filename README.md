# Software-Engineering
I worked with three members in a group; where we all had diffrent change request. But I had to commuicate to resolve conflict issues while push our work on the repository.



CHANGE REQUEST

(1) Change Request: “Add  a  slider  bar  to  the  bottom  of  the  application  for  controlling  zoom in/out.”
Report: https://github.com/Mustafa-chow/Software-Engineering/blob/master/Mustafa_Chowdhury_CR01.pdf

(2) “Add a new tool to draw regular or irregular Pentagons. After writing the 
pentagon,  it  should  automatically  stamp  user  specified  name  in  the middle  of  that pentagon with a  font size  appropriate to the  size  of  the pentagon drawn.

I implemented those change requests for my software engineering class. First I performed extract significat concept from change request to identify the location of the change, afterthat I performed impact analysis to determine which classes are impacted by the change after that I perfomed change progaration and then verification of the change and make sure other functionatilies doesn't impacted by the change.
